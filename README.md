# Introduction
BraineumVerse is a mapping of the real world into the mind-space of BraineumAI, a pseudo AI, to simplify life and its interactions. 
Users provide the content which is mainly images at the moment. As the system develops additional social media platform group features like friends, groups, interests can be added. The creation of stores that may or may not exist in the real world is also important as that would drive ecommerce interactions which will be conducted in its own native currency. As interactions grow a pseudoAI can be developed to learn from key interactions and a some point take over and perform the mundane tasks.
